# CellDataViewer

[Web version](dist)

* Arrow keys: yaw/pitch  
* Shift Arrow keys: translate x/y  
* ASDW: translate y/z
* F: Full screen (it works, but weird bug where the screen gets smaller when coming back with Esc)

This is now built on top of libgdx, so the desktop version looks the same, and
should actually work on mobile devices.

The graphics are going to look a bit clunky until I add in more of the Processing API.
